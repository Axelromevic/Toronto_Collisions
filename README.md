This is a project developed during my studies of AI, and all the information used for the project can be found in the Public Safety Data Portal of Toronto Police Service.

The objective of the project was to create a ML modedel to predict wether the scenario result in a fatal or non fatal accident, based on the data contained in the Killed or Seriously injured (KSI) Collissions dataset until 2021.
